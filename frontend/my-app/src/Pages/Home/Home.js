              <p> Pro Tip
Consider crafting, original, genuine thank you notes (one for each interviewer) the moment you get back to a computer, following the interview. The speed with which you send the notes, and the quality, will make an impact.



And finally, remember that the interviewer cares much more about what you can do for them than what you want out of the deal. Certainly, theyâ€™re going to care a bunch about what you want once you establish your worth. But during the interview, you must demonstrate why you make business sense to hire, period.

Now, go forth and show your job search exactly who is the boss.</p>
