backend: (Node, Express & MongoDB)
This is a Node.js application that uses Express.js as a framework and MongoDB as a database. The application creates a RESTful API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on user data.

## API Endpoints:

1. POST - /user/create \
Desc: This route handler handles a POST request to create a new user. It performs validation checks on the email address, password, and name of the user. If the validation checks pass, it hashes the password and saves the new user data to the database. If any validation checks fail, it returns an error response.
Parameters: a. email 
            b. password 
            c. name

2. PUT - /user/edit \
Desc: This route handler handles a PUT request to update the details of an existing user. It finds the user by email address and updates their name and hashed password. If the user is not found, it returns an error response.
Parameters: a. new_email
            b. new_password 
             c. new_name

3. DELETE - /user/delete \
Desc: This route handler handles a DELETE request to delete a user from the database. It finds the user by email address and deletes their data from the database. If the user is not found, it returns an error response.


4. GET - /user/getAll \
Desc: This route handler handles a GET request to retrieve all users from the database. It finds all user data and removes the password field from each user object before sending the user data back in the response.
